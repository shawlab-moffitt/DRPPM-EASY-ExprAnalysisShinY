# DRPPM Expression Analysis Shiny App

# Introduction

With the rapid generation of large datasets as a result of advancing next-generation sequecing (NGS) technologies, the need for quick and reproducible data analysis tools has become paramount. The ability to analyze both genomic and proteomic data sets can allow for the detection of compelling genes and features that may be of interest for further analysis. The General Expression Analysis App hosted in R Shiny does not require an extensive computation background to run these analyses. With user input of expression and meta data, along with gene set we have sourced and provided, the user may produce useful anaylsis and visualizations on a web-based interface within minutes. This method of reproducible data analysis generates a number of visualization to view Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) and differential gene expression analysis, as well as the ability to download various tables and gene sets that are produced by the App for further use.

Additional apps are being developed for the EASY family. [DRPPM-EASY-Integraction](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-Integration) allows users to further analyze data obtained from the main DRPPM-EASY app and compare expression data between two matrices. [DRPPM-EASY-CCLE](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-CCLE) integrates a sample selection tab which allows users to select expression and meta data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on cancer type or lineage and sample type for analysis within the DRPPM-EASY app. The flow chart below gives a layout of the EASY app's family infrastructure which we will describe in further detail.

# Required Files

## Required By User

* **Expression Matrix (.tsv/.txt):**
  * Must be tab delimited with gene names as symbols located in the first column with subsequent columns consiting of the sample name as the header and expression data down the column.
  *  The current App expects lowly expressed genes filtered out and normalized data either to FPKM or TMM.
     * Larger files might inflict memory issues for you local computer.
  *  This file type is required for the Getting Started Script, [GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R) as well as for within the app.
* **Meta Data (.tsv/.txt):**
  * Must be tab delimited with two columns. First column of sasmple names and second column as phenotype grouping of the samples
  * This file type is required for the Getting Started Script, [GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R) as well as for within the app.
* **GMT file or Gene Set Data (optional):**
  * If the user chooses to user their own gene set file it must be formatted correctly.
    * If using a .gmt file you can find example formatting by the Broad Institute as seen [here](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29).
    * The other option, usefull if generating your own gene sets, is making a two column tab delimited file with the first column being the gene set name repeating for every gene symbol that would be placed in the second column. Examples of this format can be seen in some of the gene set files we have provided [here](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/tree/main/GeneSets).
  * If the user chooses to use their own gene set file, it is recommended that they use the Getting Started Script, [GeneSetRDataListGen.R](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GeneSetRDataListGen.R), to generate an R data list which is needed to perform ssGSEA analysis.
  * These gene set files could be used for generating the enriched signatures table in the Getting Started Script, [GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R) as well as replacing the gene set within the DRPPM-EASY app script.
  * To simplify this optional input there is a tab within the app's GSEA section for the user to upload their own gene set file instead of hard coding it in.

## Required and Provided

* **MSigDB Files:** 
  * These gene set files were gathered from the [Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)](http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) as separate collections and processed through R to generate a master gene set file to use for GSEA and ssGSEA analysis.
  * These files begin with "msigdb_" and can be found [here](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/tree/main/GeneSets).
    * Please note that some gene sets are available for *Homo sapiens* and *Mus musculus* which are designated by HS or MM respectively.
* **Tab 2 Gene Set files:**
  * The tab 2 gene set initially written to show gene sets from the Cell Marker Database but can be adjusted by the user
  * We also provide LINCS L1000 gene sets derived from small molecule perturbations following drug treatment.
  * If the user choses to adjust this gene set they must also ensure there is an RData list file provided for it as well.
    * This file can be generated with one of the [getting started scripts](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GeneSetRDataListGen.R) we described previously.

# Pre-Processing with Getting Started Scripts

One of the file inputs for the Shiny App is the GSEA enriched signatures table for your samples. While it is not fully required to get the app running, it is a helpful tool to examine all of the gene sets in a ranked table format. The production of this table can take several minutes depending on the number of gene sets that are being ranked, but to save time we wrote a [script](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R) that requires just a few file inputs and does the rest for you! We use all of the collections from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) for the initial ranking but the getting started script and the Shiny App both allow for user input of gene set/gmt files.

### User Input for GSEA_Sig_Table_Gen.R Script

More details on these file inputs in the [Required Files](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY#required-files) section.

* `expr_file` - Expression matrix file
* `meta_file` - Meta File
* `GeneSet_file` - Gene set file as .gmt or tab delimited, as describe [here](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY#required-by-user).
  * Intial script uses MSigDB gene set file
* `OutPath` - Text input of user defined outfile path - This is where your enriched signature table(s) will be written to. The specific file naming is taken care of in the script.

### Generating Enriched Signature Table(s)

Once these files are input in the script it can be run in its entirety. The script consists of reading the files and correcting for any formatting issues, generating groups based off of the meta file, and running through the signal-to-noise calculation. Based off the groups found in the meta file, an enriched signatures table will be made for each combination of the groupings and writen to a file containing the group names being compared.

### Generating a Gene Set RData List for ssGSEA

If you choose to use your own Gene Sets either in .gmt or tab delimited format as described above, in order to perform ssGSEA analysis the Gene Set must be converted into an RData list object when loaded into the app. This list can take several minutes to generate depending on the size of the gene set file, so there is a separate script to perform this with [GeneSetRDataListGen.R](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/GettingStartedScripts/GeneSetRDataListGen.R). The only user input is the Gene Set file path and name, whether or not it has a header, and the desired outfile path and name. Once they are input, the code can be run as a whole and it will produce and save an RData list which can be input to the R Shiny app. These RData lists have already been generated for provided Gene Sets and can be found in the [Gene Sets folder](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/tree/main/GeneSets) of this repsitory.

# Prepping the R Shiny App

Similar to generating the Enriched Signatures Table, the Shiny App requires just a few user inputs and it can be up and running. Once the [app](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/app.R) script is loaded all that is needed is to update the user input and then it can be run!

### User Input for R Shiny App

Below is the begining chunk of code for the Shiny App and where the user will designate which files to use for the analysis. Here you designate the name for the app, your expression and meta data, a single or list of enriched signature tables to display (if you do not provide one you can remove the content within the parentheses), as well as your gene set seletion for the second tab of the GSEA section (initially fill with Cell Marker Gene Set data). Along with answering some `TRUE or FALSE` statements in this chunk, it should be the only secion that requires editing by the user, though to note, there is a section below in the script that calls on the MSigDB gene sets based on the 'Human' `TRUE or FALSE` statement. These paths for these files are coded in to the proper path as long as the installation instructions are followed properly.

```{r}

####----User Data Input----####

#Input desired project name for webpage - will be followed by 'Expression Analysis'
ProjectName <- "USP7 Human Demo"

##--User Input File Names--##

#expression data
expr_file <- "~/R/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY-main/ExampleData/htseq_gene_level_fpkm_T_geneName_max_1cutoff_v2.txt"

#meta data
meta_file <- "~/R/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY-main/ExampleData/USP7_meta.tsv"
#Is there a header?
header <- TRUE

#Enriched Signatures data table
ES_tables <- c("~/R/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY-main/ExampleData/USP7_Enrich_Sig.tsv")

#If human: set TRUE
#If mouse: set FALSE
human <- TRUE

##--User Gene Set Input--##

#write in the name of your gene set list for shiny UI
userGSlist_name <- 'CellMarker Gene Sets'

#path to your gene set file .gmt or .txt/.tsv
userGS_file <- '~/R/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY-main/GeneSets/CellMarker_gsNsym_HS.tsv'
#Does gene set file have header?
header.gs <- TRUE

#path to your R data list object for ssGSEA
userRData_file <- '~/R/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY-main/GeneSets/CellMarker_GS_HS.RData'

```

Once the file names and choices are correctly written you should be able to hit the "Run App" button in your R Studio desktop application load up the web page if you decide to save the code to a server.

# Shiny App Features

## Differential Gene expression Analysis

Differential gene expression analysis is performed between two groups of samples chosen by the user within the apps interface. The expression data for these groups is log transformed (log2 + 1) followed by a model matrix designed from the meta groups chosen. The matrix is then used for LIMMA linear modeling followed by Bayes statistics to rank the genes based on statistical significance. Figures and tables produce through these methods include hetmaps, volcano, MA, and box plots, as well as a gene expression scatter plot and pathway analysis with enrichR.

### Heatmaps

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/DRPPM-EASY-ExprAnalysisShinY/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/EASY_Heatmap.png?raw=true)

4. The samples are able to to be clustered with multiple methods in a drop down box
5. The Most Variable Genes will appear in the side bar below the sample cluster results
    * This table may be downloaded as a tab delimited rank file or in .gmt format to be used as a gene set.
6. Below the Most Variable Gene table are parameters to download a .gmt file based on the the Differentially Expressed Genes table

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_5.png?raw=true)

1. Users may select specific genes from a list generated from the expression matrix.
    * The starting values selected are genes involved in cytokines.
    * The starting values may be deleted with backspace and new gene options will appear in a dropdown box when the box is selected or a gene of choice is typed in the box
2. The user may also paste a list of genes in a text input box and those genes will be visualized in the heatmap
    * Please note, the genes selected in the first and second box of this side panel are stacked and will show the genes selected in both boxes
3. The heatmap will begin with all samples displayed but the user may delete ones that they do not wish to see in the Sample Selection box

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_6.png?raw=true)

1. To adjust the logFC the user must enter the absolute value of the desired fold change and it will adjust the vertical dashed line on the volcano plot and the horizontal dashed lines on the MA plot
    * The data point colors will also be adjusted based on where the points lie
2. The user may adjust the significance threshold by entering the desired P-value, where the value will be calculated as -log10 and adjust the horizontal line on the volcano plot accordingly
3. The number of top hits begins at 10 genes in each fold change direction which can be seen labeled on the volcano and MA plots
    * Please note that increasing the number of the labeled genes may decrease the visibility of the gene names depending on over lapping
4. The user may select additional genes to be labeled on the volcano and MA plots by selecting from the available list or typing in a gene of interest
5. At the top of the volcano and MA plots there will be a description based on the sample types selected.
    * The user may select different sample types to compare in the 'RNAseq Parameters' tab of the side panel
6. Below the plot will appear a text box based on the data point that the users mouse may be hovering over
    * It will not appear if the mouse is not hovering a data point

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_7.png?raw=true)

1. Users may select two genes from the expression matrix to view in a scatter plot
2. These are from the base expression plot, so there is an option to log2+1 transform the data
3. A table will show below with expression data for those genes which can be downloaded as a .tsv file

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_9.png?raw=true)

1. The user may select pathways to visualize with Enrichr for their samples
    * Below the upregulated visualization and table shows the downregulated pathway
3. The pathway analysis table can be downloaded as a .tsv file or it can be formated into a .gmt file for the selected pathway based on the genes listed in the table

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

In app, the user may select two comparison groups within the side panel which are based off of the meta file that was provided, as well a gene set by selecting from one of the gene set tables in the side panel. If the user uploads their own gene set data a table will appear based on the file input. 

**Please note:** Depending on the designated P-value selected as well as the genes in the expression matrix, there will be some gene sets that may show errors. This is due to the genes within the gene set not being significantly enriched or available to produce any data or visualizations.

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_1.png?raw=true)

1. Select comparison groups base on types of samples from the meta data file
2. Select stat comparison method for ssGSEA boxlots
    * With 2 sample types it allows for Wilcos and t-test, with 3 or more types it allows for Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA
3. You may use your own gene set either in .gmt, .tsv. or .txt format as described in the [Required Files](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/README.md#required-files) section
4. You may search for a collection or gene set of interest
5. The Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) and P-value appear at the top of the enrichment plot, as well as a message stating whether the selected gene set is up or down regulated in a sample type
6. Below the plot will show a ranked list of leading edge genes based on a signal-2-noise calculation, which may be downloaded for the users desired use

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_2.png?raw=true)

1. Based on the list of enriched signatures tables loaded into the app, their basenames will show up as a list that you may select from to view.
    * Due to this, it is helpful to be descriptive in naming the files. The table generator script does take this into account when nameing the output files

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_3.png?raw=true)

1. This tab allows you to upload your own gene set file and when uploaded it will display the list of gene sets within the file below. These can be selected to be viewed with other visualizations as well, such as the enrichment or volcano plot
2. This screenshot is showcasing the enriched signature table generation in app if you choose to perform it there rather than prior to loading the app
    * This is useful if you have a large number of sample types or if you have a specific comparison you are interested in with the gene set of your choice uploaded
    * Please keep in mind that depending on the size of the gene set data or number of samples this may take several minutes

![alt text](https://github.com/shawlab-moffitt/RShinyAnalysisGenerator/blob/main/App_Demo_Pictures/GSEA_Shiny_8.png?raw=true)

1. When viewing the ssGSEA box plot for a specific gene set, the ssGSEA enrichment score table may be downloaded
    * This can be used further in the ssGSEA analysis app that is being developed
